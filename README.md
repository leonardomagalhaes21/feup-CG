## Project - Helicopter Simulation

This project implements a 3D helicopter simulation using WebGL and the CGF framework. The helicopter can navigate through a 3D environment, collect water from a lake, and drop it on fires to extinguish them.

### Key Features
- Interactive helicopter control with realistic physics
- Water collection and fire extinguishing mechanics
- 3D terrain with lakes, forests, and buildings
- Dynamic lighting and texturing
- Custom geometric primitives (oblique cones, irregular polygons)
- Shader effects for flames and heliport animations
