# Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Project

In this project, AI was used as a consultation and inspiration tool for modeling helicopter components and other geometries.

## AI Tools Used

*   **GitHub Copilot:** Used for code autocompletion, suggestions and generating comments/documentation.

## Inspiration and Modeling

The AI assisted with:
*   **Helicopter Components:** Suggestions for solids and polygons to construct the helicopter.
*   **Oblique Cone:** Guidance on mathematical principles and algorithms to define its vertices, indices and the orientation of its surfaces.
*   **Irregular Polygons:** Exploration of triangulation methods and normal calculations for complex surfaces.

The AI was a helpful resource, offering solid theoretical foundations and optimization suggestions.
